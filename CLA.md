## Contributor License Agreement (CLA) – Summary

> This is a high-level, non-legal summary of a Contributor License Agreement model.  
> **Do not use this as-is for production deployments** without review and adaptation by qualified legal counsel in your jurisdiction.

To ensure that the AtoZ Vehicle Collision Avoidance System can be safely used, distributed, and improved over time, AtoZ Automation Solutions Pvt. Ltd. may require contributors to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

The CLA typically ensures that:

- You confirm that you have the right to submit your contribution.
- You grant AtoZ Automation Solutions Pvt. Ltd. the necessary rights to:
  - Use, modify, and distribute your contributions.
  - Re-license them under the project’s primary open-source license (GNU GPLv3-or-later) and, where applicable, under other GPL-compatible or commercial licenses, as defined in the final CLA text.
- You retain ownership of your contribution, but license it to the project under the agreed terms.
